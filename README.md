## Visualization Gallery

Visualizations created with the help of **ggplot2** and ggplot extensions, **geomtext_path** and **ggimage**. I picked select characters from popular groups of super heros & villains (Justice League, The Avengers, Guardians of The Galaxy), and plotted the values of their super abilities. Images for these characters were downloaded from the respective **[DC Fandom](https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/DC_Comics_Database)** and **[Marvel Fandom](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Marvel_Database)** sites.
